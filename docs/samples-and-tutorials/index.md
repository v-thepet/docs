# .NET samples and tutorials

The .NET documentation contains a set of samples and tutorials that teach you about .NET. This topic describes how to find, view, and download .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and C# samples and tutorials. Find resources to learn the F# programming language on the [F# Foundation's site](https://fsharp.org/learn.html). If you're interested in exploring C# using an online code editor, start with [this interactive tutorial](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/in-browser-tutorial/1) and continue with [C# interactive tutorial](../csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/index.md). For instructions on how to view and download sample code, see the [Viewing and downloading samples](#viewing-and-downloading-samples) section.

**Managed COM server Sample**

The [COM server](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/extensions/COMServerDemo) sample demonstrates the creation of a managed COM server and how it can be globally registered or consumed via RegFree COM.

**Microsoft Office PIA Sample**

The [ExcelDemo](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/extensions/ExcelDemo) sample demonstrates the consumption of [Microsoft Office PIAs](/visualstudio/vsto/office-primary-interop-assemblies) in .NET Core.

### Tutorials

## Viewing and downloading samples

Many topics show source code and samples that are available for viewing or download from GitHub. To view a sample, just follow the sample link. To download the code, follow these instructions:

1. Download the repository that contains the sample code by performing one of the following procedures:
   * Download a ZIP of the repository to your local system. Un-ZIP the compressed archive.
   * [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the fork to your local system. Forking and cloning permits you to make contributions to the documentation by committing changes to your fork and then creating a pull request for the official docs repository. For more information, see the [.NET Documentation Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [ASP.NET Docs Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
   * Clone the repository locally. If you clone a docs repository directly to your local system, you won't be able to make commits directly against the official repository, so you won't be able to make documentation contributions later. Use the fork and clone procedure previously described if you want to preserve the opportunity to contribute to the documentation later.
1. Navigate within the repository's folders to the sample's location. The relative path to the sample's location appears in your browser's address bar when you follow the link to the sample.
1. To run a sample, you have several options:
   * Use the [dotnet CLI tools](../core/tools/index.md): In a console window, navigate to the sample's folder and use dotnet CLI commands.
   * Use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link) or [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link): Open the sample by selecting **File > Open > Project/Solution** from the menu bar, navigate to the sample project folder, and select the project file (*.csproj* or *.fsproj*).
   * Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Open the sample by selecting **File > Open Folder** from the menu bar and selecting the sample's project folder.
   * Use a different IDE that supports .NET Core projects.
