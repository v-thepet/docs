# Tutorial: Containerize a .NET Core app

This tutorial teaches you how to build a Docker image that contains your .NET Core application. The image can be used to create containers for your local development environment, private cloud, or public cloud.

You'll learn to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and publish a simple .NET Core app
> * Create and configure a Dockerfile for .NET Core
> * Build a Docker image
> * Create and run a Docker container

You'll understand the Docker container build and deploy tasks for a .NET Core application. The *Docker platform* uses the *Docker engine* to quickly build and package apps as *Docker images*. These images are written in the *Dockerfile* format to be deployed and run in a layered container.

## Prerequisites

Install the following prerequisites:

* [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)\
If you have .NET Core installed, use the `dotnet --info` command to determine which SDK you're using.

* [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

* A temporary working folder for the *Dockerfile* and .NET Core example app. In this tutorial, the name `docker-working` is used as the working folder.

### Use SDK version 2.2

If you're using an SDK that is newer, like 3.0, make sure that your app is forced to use the 2.2 SDK. Create a file named `global.json` in your working folder and paste in the following json code:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "2.2.100"
  }
}
```

Save this file. The presence of file will force .NET Core to use version 2.2 for any `dotnet` command called from this folder and below.

## Create .NET Core app

You need a .NET Core app that the Docker container will run. Open your terminal, create a working folder if you haven't already, and enter it. In the working folder, run the following command to create a new project in a subdirectory named app:

```console
dotnet new console -o app -n myapp
```

Your folder tree will look like the following:

```console
docker-working
│   global.json
│
└───app
    │   myapp.csproj
    │   Program.cs
    │
    └───obj
            myapp.csproj.nuget.cache
            myapp.csproj.nuget.g.props
            myapp.csproj.nuget.g.targets
            project.assets.json
```

The `dotnet new` command creates a new folder named *app* and generates a "Hello World" app. Enter the *app* folder and run the command `dotnet run`. You'll see the following output:

```console
> dotnet run
Hello World!
```

The default template creates an app that prints to the terminal and then exits. For this tutorial, you'll use an app that loops indefinitely. Open the **Program.cs** file in a text editor. It should currently look like the following code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace myapp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the file with the following code that counts numbers every second:

```csharp
using System;

namespace myapp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var counter = 0;
            var max = args.Length != 0 ? Convert.ToInt32(args[0]) : -1;
            while(max == -1 || counter < max)
            {
                counter++;
                Console.WriteLine($"Counter: {counter}");
                System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Delay(1000).Wait();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Save the file and test the program again with `dotnet run`. Remember that this app runs indefinitely. Use the cancel command <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> to stop it. You'll see the following output:

```console
> dotnet run
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
^C
```

If you pass a number on the command line to the app, it will only count up to that amount and then exit. Try it with `dotnet run -- 5` to count to five.

> [!NOTE]
> Any parameters after `--` are not passed to the `dotnet run` command and instead are passed to your application.

## Publish .NET Core app

Before you add your .NET Core app to the Docker image, publish it. You want to make sure that the container runs the published version of the app when it's started.

From the working folder, enter the **app** folder with the example source code and run the following command:

```console
dotnet publish -c Release
```

This command compiles your app to the **publish** folder. The path to the **publish** folder from the working folder should be `.\app\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.2\publish\`

Get a directory listing of the publish folder to verify that the **myapp.dll** was created. From the **app** folder, run one of the following commands:

```console
> dir bin\Release\netcoreapp2.2\publish
 Directory of C:\docker-working\app\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.2\publish

04/05/2019  11:00 AM    <DIR>          .
04/05/2019  11:00 AM    <DIR>          ..
04/05/2019  11:00 AM               447 myapp.deps.json
04/05/2019  11:00 AM             4,608 myapp.dll
04/05/2019  11:00 AM               448 myapp.pdb
04/05/2019  11:00 AM               154 myapp.runtimeconfig.json
```

```bash
me@DESKTOP:/docker-working/app$ ls bin/Release/netcoreapp2.2/publish
myapp.deps.json  myapp.dll  myapp.pdb  myapp.runtimeconfig.json
```

## Create the Dockerfile

The *Dockerfile* file is used by the `docker build` command to create a container image. This file is a plaintext file named *Dockerfile* that does not have an extension.

In your terminal, navigate up a directory to the working folder you created at the start. Create a file named *Dockerfile* in your working folder and open it in a text editor. Add the following command as the first line of the file:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.2
```

The `FROM` command tells Docker to pull down the image tagged **2.2** from the **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime** repository. Make sure that you pull the .NET Core runtime that matches the runtime targeted by your SDK. For example, the app created in the previous section used the .NET Core 2.2 SDK and created an app that targeted .NET Core 2.2. So the base image referred to in the *Dockerfile* is tagged with **2.2**.

Save the *Dockerfile* file. The directory structure of the working folder should look like the following. Some of the deeper-level files and folders have been cut to save space in the article:

```console
docker-working
│   Dockerfile
│   global.json
│
└───app
    │   myapp.csproj
    │   Program.cs
    │
    ├───bin
    │   └───Release
    │       └───netcoreapp2.2
    │           └───publish
    │                   myapp.deps.json
    │                   myapp.dll
    │                   myapp.pdb
    │                   myapp.runtimeconfig.json
    │
    └───obj
```

From your terminal, run the following command:

```console
docker build -t myimage -f Dockerfile .
```

Docker will process each line in the *Dockerfile*. The `.` in the `docker build` command tells Docker to use the current folder to find a *Dockerfile*. This command builds the image and creates a local repository named **myimage** that points to that image. After this command finishes, run `docker images` to see a list of images installed:

```console
> docker images
REPOSITORY                              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime   2.2                 d51bb4452469        2 days ago          314MB
myimage                                 latest              d51bb4452469        2 days ago          314MB
```

Notice that the two images share the same **IMAGE ID** value. The value is the same between both images because the only command in the *Dockerfile* was to base the new image on an existing image. Let's add two commands to the *Dockerfile*. Each command creates a new image layer with the final command representing the image the **myimage** repository will point to.

```dockerfile
COPY app/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.2/publish/ app/

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "app/myapp.dll"]
```

The `COPY` command tells Docker to copy the specified folder on your computer to a folder in the container. In this example, the **publish** folder is copied to a folder named **app** in the container.

The next command, `ENTRYPOINT`, tells Docker to configure the container to run as an executable. When the container starts, the `ENTRYPOINT` command runs. When this command ends, the container will automatically stop.

From your terminal, run `docker build -t myimage -f Dockerfile .` and when that command finishes, run `docker images`.

```console
> docker build -t myimage -f Dockerfile .

REPOSITORY                              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
myimage                                 latest              ddcc6646461b        10 seconds ago      314MB
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime   2.2                 d51bb4452469        2 days ago          314MB
```

Each command in the *Dockerfile* generated a layer and created an **IMAGE ID**. The final **IMAGE ID** (yours will be different) is **ddcc6646461b** and next you'll create a container based on this image.

## Create a container

Now that you have an image that contains your app, you can create a container. You can create a container in two ways. First, create a new container that is stopped.

```console
> docker create myimage
0e8f3c2ca32ce773712a5cca38750f41259a4e54e04bdf0946087e230ad7066c
```

The `docker create` command from above will create a container based on the **myimage** image. The output of that command shows you the **CONTAINER ID** (yours will be different) of the created container. To see a list of *all* containers, use the `docker ps -a` command:

```console
> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS        PORTS   NAMES
0e8f3c2ca32c        myimage             "dotnet app/myapp.dll"   4 seconds ago       Created               boring_matsumoto
```

### Manage the container

Each container is assigned a random name that you can use to refer to that container instance. For example, the container that was created automatically chose the name **boring_matsumoto** (yours will be different) and that name can be used to start the container. You override the automatic name with a specific one by using the `docker create --name` parameter.

The following example uses the `docker start` command to start the container, and then uses the `docker ps` command to only show containers that are running:

```console
> docker start boring_matsumoto
boring_matsumoto

> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS         PORTS   NAMES
0e8f3c2ca32c        myimage             "dotnet app/myapp.dll"   7 minutes ago       Up 8 seconds           boring_matsumoto
```

Similarly, the `docker stop` command will stop the container. The following example uses the `docker stop` command to stop the container, and then uses the `docker ps` command to show that no containers are running.

```console
> docker stop boring_matsumoto
boring_matsumoto

> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS     PORTS   NAMES
```

### Connect to a container

After a container is running, you can connect to it to see the output. Use the `docker start` and `docker attach` commands to start the container and peek at the output stream. In this example, the <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> command is used to detach from the running container. This may actually end the process in the container, which will stop the container. The `--sig-proxy=false` parameter ensures that <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> won't stop the process in the container.

After you detach from the container, reattach to verify that it's still running and counting.

```console
> docker start boring_matsumoto
boring_matsumoto

> docker attach --sig-proxy=false boring_matsumoto
Counter: 7
Counter: 8
Counter: 9
^C

> docker attach --sig-proxy=false boring_matsumoto
Counter: 17
Counter: 18
Counter: 19
^C
```

### Delete a container

For the purposes of this article you don't want containers just hanging around doing nothing. Delete the container you previously created. If the container is running, stop it.

```console
> docker stop boring_matsumoto
```

The following example lists all containers. It then uses the `docker rm` command to delete the container, and then checks a second time for any running containers.

```console
> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS     PORTS   NAMES
0e8f3c2ca32c        myimage             "dotnet app/myapp.dll"   19 minutes ago      Exited             boring_matsumoto

> docker rm boring_matsumoto
boring_matsumoto

> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS     PORTS    NAMES
```

### Single run

Docker provides the `docker run` command to create and run the container as a single command. This command eliminates the need to run `docker create` and then `docker start`. You can also set this command to automatically delete the container when the container stops. For example, use `docker run -it --rm` to do two things, first, automatically use the current terminal to connect to the container, and then when the container finishes, remove it:

```
> docker run -it --rm myimage
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
^C
```

With `docker run -it`, the <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> command will stop process that is running in the container, which in turn, stops the container. Since the `--rm` parameter was provided, the container is automatically deleted when the process is stopped. Verify that it does not exist:

```
> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS    PORTS   NAMES
```

### Change the ENTRYPOINT

The `docker run` command also lets you modify the `ENTRYPOINT` command from the *Dockerfile* and run something else, but only for that container. For example, use the following command to run `bash` or `cmd.exe`. Edit the command as necessary.

#### Windows
In this example, `ENTRYPOINT` is changed to `cmd.exe`. <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> is pressed to end the process and stop the container.

```console
> docker run -it --rm --entrypoint "cmd.exe" myimage

#### Linux

In this example, `ENTRYPOINT` is changed to `bash`. The `quit` command is run which ends the process and stop the container.

```bash
root@user:~# docker run -it --rm --entrypoint "bash" myimage

myapp.deps.json  myapp.dll  myapp.pdb  myapp.runtimeconfig.json
root@8515e897c893:/# exit
exit
```

## Essential commands

Docker has many different commands that cover what you want to do with your container and images. These Docker commands are essential to managing your containers:

* [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
* [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
* [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)
* [docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/)
* [docker rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/)
* [docker rmi](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi/)
* [docker image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/)

## Clean up resources

During this tutorial you created containers and images. If you want, delete these resources. Use the following commands to

01. List all containers

    ```console
    > docker ps -a
    ```

02. Stop containers that are running. The `CONTAINER_NAME` represents the name automatically assigned to the container.

    ```console
    > docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
    ```

03. Delete the container

    ```console
    > docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
    ```

Next, delete any images that you no longer want on your machine. Delete the image created by your *Dockerfile* and then delete the .NET Core image the *Dockerfile* was based on. You can use the **IMAGE ID** or the **REPOSITORY:TAG** formatted string.

```console
docker rmi myimage:latest
docker rmi mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.2
```

Use the `docker images` command to see a list of images installed.

> [!NOTE]
> Image files can be large. Typically, you would remove temporary containers you created while testing and developing your app. You usually keep the base images with the runtime installed if you plan on building other images based on that runtime.
