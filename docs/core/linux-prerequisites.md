# Prerequisites for .NET Core on Linux

This article shows the dependencies needed to develop .NET Core applications on Linux. The supported Linux distributions/versions, and dependencies that follow apply to the two ways of developing .NET Core apps on Linux:

* [Command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> The .NET Core SDK package is not required for production servers/environments. Only the .NET Core runtime package is needed for apps deployed to production environments. The .NET Core runtime is deployed with apps as part of a self-contained deployment, however, it must be deployed for Framework-dependent deployed apps separately. For more information about framework-dependent and self-contained deployment types, see [.NET Core application deployment](./deploying/index.md). Also see [Self-contained Linux applications](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md) for specific guidelines.

## Supported Linux versions

# [.NET Core 2.x](#tab/netcore2x)

.NET Core 2.x treats Linux as a single operating system. There is a single Linux build (per chip architecture) for supported Linux distributions.

# [.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1](#tab/netcore30)

.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 treats Linux as a single operating system. There is a single Linux build (per chip architecture) for supported Linux distributions. 

For download links and more information, see [.NET Core 3.0 downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 is supported on the following Linux distributions/versions. 

OS                            | Version               | Architectures  
------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------
Red Hat Enterprise Linux      | 6                     | x64
Red Hat Enterprise Linux<br>CentOS<br>Oracle Linux  | 7                     | x64
Fedora                        | 28                    | x64
Debian                        | 9                     | x64, ARM32\*, ARM64\*
Ubuntu                        | 16.04+, 18.04+        | x64, ARM32\*, ARM64\*

Alpine Linux                  | 3.8+                  | x64, ARM64

\* ARM32 and ARM64 support starts with Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04. Earlier versions of those distros are not supported on ARM chips.

See [.NET Core 3.0 Supported OS Versions](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.0/3.0-supported-os.md) for the complete list of .NET Core 3.0 supported operating systems, distributions and versions, out of support OS versions, and lifecycle policy links.

## Linux distribution dependencies

The following are intended to be examples. The exact versions and names may vary slightly on your Linux distribution of choice.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu distributions require the following libraries installed:

* liblttng-ust0
* libcurl3 (for 14.x and 16.x)
* libcurl4 (for 18.x)
* libssl1.0.0
* libkrb5-3
* zlib1g
* libicu52 (for 14.x)
* libicu55 (for 16.x)
* libicu57 (for 17.x)
* libicu60 (for 18.x)

For versions earlier than .NET Core 2.1, following dependencies are also required:

* libunwind8
* libuuid1

### CentOS and Fedora

CentOS distributions require the following libraries installed:

* lttng-ust
* libcurl
* openssl-libs
* krb5-libs
* libicu
* zlib

Fedora users: If your openssl's version >= 1.1, you'll need to install compat-openssl10.

For versions earlier than .NET Core 2.1, following dependencies are also required:

* libunwind
* libuuid

For more information about the dependencies, see [Self-contained Linux applications](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md).

## Installing .NET Core dependencies with the native installers

.NET Core native installers are available for supported Linux distributions/versions. The native installers require admin (sudo) access to the server. The advantage of using a native installer is that all of the .NET Core native dependencies are installed. Native installers also install the .NET Core SDK system-wide.

On Linux, there are two installer package choices:

* Using a feed-based package manager, such as apt-get for Ubuntu, or yum for CentOS/RHEL.
* Using the packages themselves, DEB or RPM.

### Scripting Installs with the .NET Core installer script

The [dotnet-install scripts](./tools/dotnet-install-script.md) are used to perform a non-admin install of the CLI toolchain and the shared runtime. You can download the script from <https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh>.

The script defaults to installing the latest "LTS" version, which is currently .NET Core 1.1. To install .NET Core 2.1, run the script with the following switch:

```console
./dotnet-install.sh -c Current
```

The installer bash script is used in automation scenarios and non-admin installations. This script also reads PowerShell switches, so they can be used with the script on Linux/OS X systems.

## Troubleshoot

If you have problems with a .NET Core installation on a supported Linux distribution/version, consult the following topics for your installed distributions/versions:
