## Description

`dotnet` is a tool for managing .NET source code and binaries. It exposes commands that perform specific tasks, such as [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md) and [`dotnet run`](dotnet-run.md). Each command defines its own arguments. Type `--help` after each command to access brief help documentation.

`dotnet` can be used to run applications, by specifying an application DLL, such as `dotnet myapp.dll`. See [.NET Core application deployment](../deploying/index.md) for to learn about deployment options.

## Options

# [.NET Core 2.1](#tab/netcore21)

`--additional-deps <PATH>`

Path to additional *.deps.json* file.

`--additionalprobingpath <PATH>`

Path containing probing policy and assemblies to probe.

`-d|--diagnostics`

Enables diagnostic output.

`--fx-version <VERSION>`

Version of the .NET Core runtime to use to run the application.

`-h|--help`

Prints out documentation for a given command, such as `dotnet build --help`. `dotnet --help` prints a list of available commands.

`--info`

Prints out detailed information about a .NET Core installation and the machine environment, such as the current operating system, and commit SHA of the .NET Core version.

`--list-runtimes`

Displays the installed .NET Core runtimes.

`--list-sdks`

Displays the installed .NET Core SDKs.

`--roll-forward-on-no-candidate-fx <N>`

Defines behavior when the required shared framework is not available. `N` can be:
* `0` - Disable even minor version roll forward.
* `1` - Roll forward on minor version, but not on major version. This is the default behavior.
* `2` - Roll forward on minor and major versions.

 For more information, see [Roll forward](../whats-new/dotnet-core-2-1.md#roll-forward).

`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`

Sets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`. Not supported in every command; see specific command page to determine if this option is available.

## Environment variables

# [.NET Core 2.1](#tab/netcore21)

`DOTNET_PACKAGES`

The global packages folder. If not set, it defaults to `~/.nuget/packages` on Unix or `%userprofile%\.nuget\packages` on Windows.

`DOTNET_SERVICING`

Specifies the location of the servicing index to use by the shared host when loading the runtime.

`DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`

Specifies whether data about the .NET Core tools usage is collected and sent to Microsoft. Set to `true` to opt-out of the telemetry feature (values `true`, `1`, or `yes` accepted). Otherwise, set to `false` to opt into the telemetry features (values `false`, `0`, or `no` accepted). If not set, the default is `false` and the telemetry feature is active.

`DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP`

Specifies whether .NET Core runtime, shared framework, or SDK are resolved from the global location. If not set, it defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to not resolve from the global location and have isolated .NET Core installations (values `0` or `false` are accepted). For more information about multi-level lookup, see [Multi-level SharedFX Lookup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/Documentation/design-docs/multilevel-sharedfx-lookup.md).
