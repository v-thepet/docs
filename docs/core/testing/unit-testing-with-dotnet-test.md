# Unit testing C# in .NET Core using dotnet test and xUnit

This tutorial takes you through an interactive experience building a sample solution step-by-step to learn unit testing concepts. If you prefer to follow the tutorial using a pre-built solution, [view or download the sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/) before you begin. For download instructions, see [Samples and Tutorials](../../samples-and-tutorials/index.md#viewing-and-downloading-samples).

## Creating the source project

Open a shell window. Create a directory called *unit-testing-using-dotnet-test* to hold the solution.
Inside this new directory, run [`dotnet new sln`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) to create a new solution. Having a solution 
makes it easier to manage both the class library and the unit test project.
Inside the solution directory, create a *PrimeService* directory. The directory and file structure thus far should be as follows:

```
/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test
    unit-testing-using-dotnet-test.sln
    /PrimeService
```

Make *PrimeService* the current directory and run [`dotnet new classlib`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) to create the source project. Rename *Class1.cs* to *PrimeService.cs*. You first create a failing implementation of the `PrimeService` class:

```csharp
using System;

namespace Prime.Services
{
    public class PrimeService
    {
        public bool IsPrime(int candidate)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException("Please create a test first.");
        }
    }
}
```

Change the directory back to the *unit-testing-using-dotnet-test* directory.

Run the [dotnet sln](../tools/dotnet-sln.md) command to add the class library project to the solution:

```
dotnet sln add ./PrimeService/PrimeService.csproj
```

## Creating the test project

Next, create the *PrimeService.Tests* directory. The following outline shows the directory structure:

```
/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test
    unit-testing-using-dotnet-test.sln
    /PrimeService
        Source Files
        PrimeService.csproj
    /PrimeService.Tests
```

Make the *PrimeService.Tests* directory the current directory and create a new project using [`dotnet new xunit`](../tools/dotnet-new.md). This command creates a test project that uses [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) as the test library. The generated template configures the test runner in the *PrimeServiceTests.csproj* file similar to the following code:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="15.3.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.2.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The test project requires other packages to create and run unit tests. `dotnet new` in the previous step added xUnit and the xUnit runner. Now, add the `PrimeService` class library as another dependency to the project. Use the [`dotnet add reference`](../tools/dotnet-add-reference.md) command:

```
dotnet add reference ../PrimeService/PrimeService.csproj
```

You can see the entire file in the [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.csproj) on GitHub.

The following shows the final solution layout:

```
/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test
    unit-testing-using-dotnet-test.sln
    /PrimeService
        Source Files
        PrimeService.csproj
    /PrimeService.Tests
        Test Source Files
        PrimeServiceTests.csproj
```

To add the test project to the solution, run the [dotnet sln](../tools/dotnet-sln.md) command in the *unit-testing-using-dotnet-test* directory:

```
dotnet sln add ./PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.csproj
```

## Creating the first test

You write one failing test, make it pass, then repeat the process. Remove *UnitTest1.cs* from the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and create a new C# file named *PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs*. Add the following code:

```csharp
using Xunit;
using Prime.Services;

namespace Prime.UnitTests.Services
{
    public class PrimeService_IsPrimeShould
    {
        private readonly PrimeService _primeService;

        public PrimeService_IsPrimeShould()
        {
            _primeService = new PrimeService();
        }

        [Fact]
        public void IsPrime_InputIs1_ReturnFalse()
        {
            var result = _primeService.IsPrime(1);

            Assert.False(result, "1 should not be prime");
        }
    }
}
```

The `[Fact]` attribute indicates a test method that is run by the test runner. From the *PrimeService.Tests* folder, execute [`dotnet test`](../tools/dotnet-test.md) to build the tests and the class library and then run the tests. The xUnit test runner contains the program entry point to run your tests. `dotnet test` starts the test runner using the unit test project you've created.

Your test fails. You haven't created the implementation yet. Make this test pass by writing the simplest code in the `PrimeService` class that works. Replace the existing `IsPrime` method implementation with the following code:

```csharp
public bool IsPrime(int candidate)
{
    if (candidate == 1)
    {
        return false;
    }
    throw new NotImplementedException("Please create a test first.");
}
```

In the *PrimeService.Tests* directory, run `dotnet test` again. The `dotnet test` command runs a build for the `PrimeService` project and then for the `PrimeService.Tests` project. After building both projects, it runs this single test. It passes.

## Adding more features

Now that you've made one test pass, it's time to write more. There are a few other simple cases for prime numbers: 0, -1. You could add those cases as new tests with the `[Fact]` attribute, but that quickly becomes tedious. There are other xUnit attributes that enable you to write a suite of similar tests:

- `[Theory]` represents a suite of tests that execute the same code but have different input arguments.

- `[InlineData]` attribute specifies values for those inputs.

Instead of creating new tests, apply these two attributes, `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]`, to create a single theory in the *PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs* file. The theory is a method that tests several values less than two, which is the lowest prime number:

[!code-csharp[Sample_TestCode](../../../samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs?name=Sample_TestCode)]

Run `dotnet test` again, and two of these tests should fail. To make all of the tests pass, change the `if` clause at the beginning of the `IsPrime` method in the *PrimeService.cs* file:

```csharp
if (candidate < 2)
```

Continue to iterate by adding more tests, more theories, and more code in the main library. You have the [finished version of the tests](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs) and the [complete implementation of the library](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/PrimeService/PrimeService.cs).
