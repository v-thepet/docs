# Test published output with dotnet vstest

You can run tests on already published output by using the `dotnet vstest` command. This will work on xUnit, MSTest, and NUnit tests. Simply locate the DLL file that was part of your published output and run:

```
dotnet vstest <MyPublishedTests>.dll
```

Where `<MyPublishedTests>` is the name of your published test project.

## Example

The commands below demonstrate running tests on a published DLL.

```
dotnet new mstest -o MyProject.Tests
cd MyProject.Tests
dotnet publish -o out
dotnet vstest out/MyProject.Tests.dll
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note: If your app is targeting a framework other than `netcoreapp` you can still run the `dotnet vstest` command by passing in the targeted framework with a framework flag. For example, `dotnet vstest <MyPublishedTests>.dll  --Framework:".NETFramework,Version=v4.6"`. In Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 the desired framework is automatically detected.
