# Compiler Error CS0819
Implicitly typed locals cannot have multiple declarators.  
  
 Multiple declarators are allowed in explicit type declarations, but not with implicitly typed variables.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Declare and assign a value to each implicitly typed local variable on a separate line.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS0819:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0819.cs  
class A  
{  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        var a = 3, b = 2; // CS0819  
        return -1;  
    }  
}  
```
