# Equality operators (C# reference)

The [`==` (equality)](#equality-operator-) and [`!=` (inequality)](#inequality-operator-) operators check if their operands are equal or not.

## Equality operator ==

The equality operator `==` returns `true` if its operands are equal, `false` otherwise.

### Value types equality

Operands of the [built-in value types](../keywords/value-types-table.md) are equal if their values are equal:

[!code-csharp-interactive[value types equality](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#ValueTypesEquality)]

> [!NOTE]
> For the `==`, [`<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`](comparison-operators.md) operators, if any of the operands is not a number (<xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType>), the result of operation is `false`. That means that the `NaN` value is neither greater than, less than, nor equal to any other `double` (or `float`) value, including `NaN`. For more information and examples, see the <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> reference article.

Two operands of the same [enum](../keywords/enum.md) type are equal if the corresponding values of the underlying integral type are equal.

User-defined [struct](../keywords/struct.md) types don't support the `==` operator by default. To support the `==` operator, a user-defined struct must [overload](#operator-overloadability) it.

Beginning with C# 7.3, the `==` and `!=` operators are supported by C# [tuples](../../tuples.md). For more information, see the [Equality and tuples](../../tuples.md#equality-and-tuples) section of the [C# tuple types](../../tuples.md) article.

### Reference types equality

By default, two reference-type operands are equal if they refer to the same object:

[!code-csharp[reference type equality](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#ReferenceTypesEquality)]

As the example shows, user-defined reference types support the `==` operator by default. However, a reference type can overload the `==` operator. If a reference type overloads the `==` operator, use the <xref:System.Object.ReferenceEquals%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to check if two references of that type refer to the same object.

### String equality

Two [string](../keywords/string.md) operands are equal when both of them are `null` or both string instances are of the same length and have identical characters in each character position:

[!code-csharp-interactive[string equality](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#StringEquality)]

That is case-sensitive ordinal comparison. For more information about string comparison, see [How to compare strings in C#](../../how-to/compare-strings.md).

### Delegate equality

Two [delegate](../../programming-guide/delegates/index.md) operands of the same runtime type are equal when both of them are `null` or their invocation lists are of the same length and have equal entries in each position:

[!code-csharp-interactive[delegate equality](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#DelegateEquality)]

For more information, see the [Delegate equality operators](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#delegate-equality-operators) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).

Delegates that are produced from evaluation of semantically identical [lambda expressions](../../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md) are not equal, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[from identical lambdas](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#IdenticalLambdas)]

## Inequality operator !=

The inequality operator `!=` returns `true` if its operands are not equal, `false` otherwise. For the operands of the [built-in types](../keywords/built-in-types-table.md), the expression `x != y` produces the same result as the expression `!(x == y)`. For more information about type equality, see the [Equality operator](#equality-operator-) section.

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `!=` operator:

[!code-csharp-interactive[non-equality examples](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/EqualityOperators.cs#NonEquality)]

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type can [overload](operator-overloading.md) the `==` and `!=` operators. If a type overloads one of the two operators, it must also overload another one.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Relational and type-testing operators](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#relational-and-type-testing-operators) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).
