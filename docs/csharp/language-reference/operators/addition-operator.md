# + and += operators (C# reference)

The `+` operator is supported by the built-in numeric types, [string](../keywords/string.md) type, and [delegate](../keywords/delegate.md) types.

For information about the arithmetic `+` operator, see the [Unary plus and minus operators](arithmetic-operators.md#unary-plus-and-minus-operators) and [Addition operator +](arithmetic-operators.md#addition-operator-) sections of the [Arithmetic operators](arithmetic-operators.md) article.

## String concatenation

When one or both operands are of type [string](../keywords/string.md), the `+` operator concatenates the string representations of its operands:

[!code-csharp-interactive[string concatenation](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/AdditionOperator.cs#AddStrings)]

Starting with C# 6, [string interpolation](../tokens/interpolated.md) provides a more convenient way to format strings:

[!code-csharp-interactive[string interpolation](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/AdditionOperator.cs#UseStringInterpolation)]

## Delegate combination

For operands of the same [delegate](../keywords/delegate.md) type, the `+` operator returns a new delegate instance that, when invoked, invokes the left-hand operand and then invokes the right-hand operand. If any of the operands is `null`, the `+` operator returns the value of another operand (which also might be `null`). The following example shows how delegates can be combined with the `+` operator:

[!code-csharp-interactive[delegate combination](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/AdditionOperator.cs#AddDelegates)]

To perform delegate removal, use the [`-` operator](subtraction-operator.md#delegate-removal).

For more information about delegate types, see [Delegates](../../programming-guide/delegates/index.md).

## Addition assignment operator +=

An expression using the `+=` operator, such as

```csharp
x += y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
x = x + y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.
  
The following example demonstrates the usage of the `+=` operator:

[!code-csharp-interactive[+= examples](~/samples/csharp/language-reference/operators/AdditionOperator.cs#AddAndAssign)]

You also use the `+=` operator to specify an event handler method when you subscribe to an [event](../keywords/event.md). For more information, see [How to: subscribe to and unsubscribe from events](../../programming-guide/events/how-to-subscribe-to-and-unsubscribe-from-events.md).

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type can [overload](operator-overloading.md) the `+` operator. When a binary `+` operator is overloaded, the `+=` operator is also implicitly overloaded. A user-defined type cannot explicitly overload the `+=` operator.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Unary plus operator](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#unary-plus-operator) and [Addition operator](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#addition-operator) sections of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).
