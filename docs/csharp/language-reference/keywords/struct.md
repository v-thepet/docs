# struct (C# Reference)

A `struct` type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. The following example shows a simple struct declaration:

```csharp
public struct Book
{
    public decimal price;
    public string title;
    public string author;
}
```

## Remarks

Structs can also contain [constructors](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md), [constants](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md), [fields](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields.md), [methods](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md), [properties](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [indexers](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md), [operators](../../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/operators.md), [events](../../programming-guide/events/index.md), and [nested types](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/nested-types.md), although if several such members are required, you should consider making your type a class instead.

For examples, see [Using Structs](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md).

Structs can implement an interface but they cannot inherit from another struct. For that reason, struct members cannot be declared as `protected`.

For more information, see [Structs](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/structs.md).
