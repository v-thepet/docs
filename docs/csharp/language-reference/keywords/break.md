# break (C# Reference)

The `break` statement terminates the closest enclosing loop or [switch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch.md) statement in which it appears. Control is passed to the statement that follows the terminated statement, if any.

## Example

In this example, the conditional statement contains a counter that is supposed to count from 1 to 100; however, the `break` statement terminates the loop after 4 counts.

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsJump#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsJump/CS/csrefKeywordsJump.cs#1)]

## Example

In this example, the `break` statement is used to break out of an inner nested loop, and return control to the outer loop.

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsJump#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsJump/CS/csrefKeywordsJump.cs#7)]

## Example

This example demonstrates the use of `break` in a [switch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch.md) statement.

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsJump#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsJump/CS/csrefKeywordsJump.cs#2)]

If you entered `4`, the output would be:

```console
Enter your selection (1, 2, or 3): 4
Sorry, invalid selection.
```
