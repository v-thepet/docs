# where (generic type constraint) (C# Reference)

The `where` clause in a generic definition specifies constraints on the types that are used as arguments for type parameters in a generic type, method, delegate, or local function. Constraints can specify interfaces, base classes, or require a generic type to be a reference, value or unmanaged type. They declare capabilities that the type argument must possess.

For example, you can declare a generic class, `MyGenericClass`, such that the type parameter `T` implements the <xref:System.IComparable%601> interface:

[!code-csharp[using an interface constraint](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#1)]

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the where clause in a query expression, see [where clause](where-clause.md).

The `where` clause can also include a base class constraint. The base class constraint states that a type to be used as a type argument for that generic type has the specified class as a base class (or is that base class) to be used as a type argument for that generic type. If the base class constraint is used, it must appear before any other constraints on that type parameter. Some types are disallowed as a base class constraint: <xref:System.Object>, <xref:System.Array>, and <xref:System.ValueType>. Prior to C# 7.3, <xref:System.Enum>, <xref:System.Delegate>, and <xref:System.MulticastDelegate> were also disallowed as base class constraints. The following example shows the types that can now be specified as a base class:

[!code-csharp[using an interface constraint](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#2)]

The `where` clause can specify that the type is a `class` or a `struct`. The `struct` constraint removes the need to specify a base class constraint of `System.ValueType`. The `System.ValueType` type may not be used as a base class constraint. The following example shows both the `class` and `struct` constraints:

[!code-csharp[using the class and struct constraints](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#3)]

The `where` clause may also include an `unmanaged` constraint. The `unmanaged` constraint limits the type parameter to types known as [unmanaged types](../builtin-types/unmanaged-types.md). The `unmanaged` constraint makes it easier to write low-level interop code in C#. This constraint enables reusable routines across all unmanaged types. The `unmanaged` constraint can't be combined with the `class` or `struct` constraint. The `unmanaged` constraint enforces that the type must be a `struct`:

[!code-csharp[using the unmanaged constraint](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#4)]

The `where` clause may also include a constructor constraint, `new()`. That constraint makes it possible to create an instance of a type parameter using the `new` operator. The [new() Constraint](new-constraint.md) lets the compiler know that any type argument supplied must have an accessible parameterless--or default-- constructor. For example:

[!code-csharp[using the new constraint](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#5)]

The `new()` constraint appears last in the `where` clause. The `new()` constraint can't be combined with the `struct` or `unmanaged` constraints. All types satisfying those constraints must have an accessible parameterless constructor, making the `new()` constraint redundant.

With multiple type parameters, use one `where` clause for each type parameter, for example:

[!code-csharp[using multiple where constraints](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#6)]

You can also attach constraints to type parameters of generic methods, as shown in the following example:

[!code-csharp[where constraints with generic methods](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#7)]

Notice that the syntax to describe type parameter constraints on delegates is the same as that of methods:

[!code-csharp[where constraints with generic methods](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/keywords/GenericWhereConstraints.cs#8)]

For information on generic delegates, see [Generic Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-delegates.md).
