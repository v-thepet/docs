# Floating-point numeric types (C# reference)

The **floating-point types** are a subset of the **simple types** and can be initialized with [*literals*](#floating-point-literals). All floating-point types are also value types. All floating-point numeric types support [arithmetic](../operators/arithmetic-operators.md), [comparison, and equality](../operators/equality-operators.md) operators.

## Characteristics of the floating-point types

C# supports the following predefined floating-point types:
  
|C# type/keyword|Approximate range|Precision|.NET type|
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|
|`float`|±1.5 x 10<sup>−45</sup> to ±3.4 x 10<sup>38</sup>|~6-9 digits|<xref:System.Single?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|`double`|±5.0 × 10<sup>−324</sup> to ±1.7 × 10<sup>308</sup>|~15-17 digits|<xref:System.Double?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|`decimal`|±1.0 x 10<sup>-28</sup> to ±7.9228 x 10<sup>28</sup>|28-29 digits|<xref:System.Decimal?displayProperty=nameWithType>|

In the preceding table, each C# type keyword from the leftmost column is an alias for the corresponding .NET type. They are interchangeable. For example, the following declarations declare variables of the same type:

```csharp
double a = 12.3;
System.Double b = 12.3;
```

The default value of each floating-point type is zero, `0`. Each of the floating-point types has the `MinValue` and `MaxValue` constants that provide the minimum and maximum finite value of that type. The `float` and `double` types also provide constants that represent not-a-number and infinity values. For example, the `double` type provides the following constants: <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Double.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

Because the `decimal` type has more precision and a smaller range than both `float` and `double`, it's appropriate for financial and monetary calculations.

You can mix [integral](integral-numeric-types.md) types and floating-point types in an expression. In this case, the integral types are converted to floating-point types. The evaluation of the expression is performed according to the following rules:

- If one of the floating-point types is `double`, the expression evaluates to `double`, or to [bool](../keywords/bool.md) in relational comparisons or comparisons for equality.
- If there is no `double` type in the expression, the expression evaluates to `float`, or to [bool](../keywords/bool.md) in relational comparisons or comparisons for equality.

A floating-point expression can contain the following sets of values:

- Positive and negative zero
- Positive and negative infinity
- Not-a-Number value (NaN)
- The finite set of nonzero values

For more information about these values, see IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, available on the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) website.

You can use either [standard numeric format strings](../../../standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings.md) or [custom numeric format strings](../../../standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings.md) to format a floating-point value.

## Floating-point literals

By default, a floating-point numeric literal on the right side of the assignment operator is treated as `double`. You can use suffixes to convert a floating-point or integral literal to a specific type:

- The `d` or `D` suffix converts a literal to a `double`.
- The `f` or `F` suffix converts a literal to a `float`.
- The `m` or `M` suffix converts a literal to a `decimal`.

The following examples show each suffix:

```csharp
double d = 3D;
d = 4d;
float f = 3.5F;
f = 5.4f;
decimal myMoney = 300.5m;
myMoney = 400.75M;
```

## Conversions

There's an implicit conversion (called a *widening conversion*) from `float` to `double` because the range of `float` values is a proper subset of `double` and there is no loss of precision from `float` to `double`.

You must use an explicit cast to convert one floating-point type to another floating-point type when an implicit conversion isn't defined from the source type to the destination type. This is called a *narrowing conversion*. The explicit case is required because the conversion can result in data loss. There's no implicit conversion between other floating-point types and the `decimal` type because the `decimal` type has greater precision than either `float` or `double`.

For more information about implicit numeric conversions, see [Implicit Numeric Conversions Table](../keywords/implicit-numeric-conversions-table.md).

For more information about explicit numeric conversions, see [Explicit Numeric Conversions Table](../keywords/explicit-numeric-conversions-table.md).
