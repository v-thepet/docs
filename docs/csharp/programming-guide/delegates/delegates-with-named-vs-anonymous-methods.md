# Delegates with Named vs. Anonymous Methods (C# Programming Guide)
A [delegate](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md) can be associated with a named method. When you instantiate a delegate by using a named method, the method is passed as a parameter, for example:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideDelegates#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideDelegates/CS/Delegates.cs#1)]  
  
 This is called using a named method. Delegates constructed with a named method can encapsulate either a [static](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/static.md) method or an instance method. Named methods are the only way to instantiate a delegate in earlier versions of C#. However, in a situation where creating a new method is unwanted overhead, C# enables you to instantiate a delegate and immediately specify a code block that the delegate will process when it is called. The block can contain either a lambda expression or an anonymous method. For more information, see [Anonymous Functions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-functions.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The method that you pass as a delegate parameter must have the same signature as the delegate declaration.  
  
 A delegate instance may encapsulate either static or instance method.  
  
 Although the delegate can use an [out](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier.md) parameter, we do not recommend its use with multicast event delegates because you cannot know which delegate will be called.  
  
## Example 1  
 The following is a simple example of declaring and using a delegate. Notice that both the delegate, `Del`, and the associated method, `MultiplyNumbers`, have the same signature

## Example 2  
 In the following example, one delegate is mapped to both static and instance methods and returns specific information from each.
