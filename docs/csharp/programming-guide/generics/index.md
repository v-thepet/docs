# Generics (C# Programming Guide)
Generics were added to version 2.0 of the C# language and the common language runtime (CLR). Generics introduce to the .NET Framework the concept of type parameters, which make it possible to design classes and methods that defer the specification of one or more types until the class or method is declared and instantiated by client code. For example, by using a generic type parameter T you can write a single class that other client code can use without incurring the cost or risk of runtime casts or boxing operations, as shown here:

Generic classes and methods combine reusability, type safety and efficiency in a way that their non-generic counterparts cannot. Generics are most frequently used with collections and the methods that operate on them. Version 2.0 of the .NET Framework class library provides a new namespace, <xref:System.Collections.Generic>, which contains several new generic-based collection classes. It is recommended that all applications that target the .NET Framework 2.0 and later use the new generic collection classes instead of the older non-generic counterparts such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>. For more information, see [Generics in .NET](../../../standard/generics/index.md).  
  
 Of course, you can also create custom generic types and methods to provide your own generalized solutions and design patterns that are type-safe and efficient. The following code example shows a simple generic linked-list class for demonstration purposes. (In most cases, you should use the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> class provided by the .NET Framework class library instead of creating your own.) The type parameter `T` is used in several locations where a concrete type would ordinarily be used to indicate the type of the item stored in the list. It is used in the following ways:  
  
- As the type of a method parameter in the `AddHead` method.  
  
- As the return type of the `Data` property in the nested `Node` class.  
  
- As the type of the private member `data` in the nested class.  
  
 Note that T is available to the nested `Node` class. When `GenericList<T>` is instantiated with a concrete type, for example as a `GenericList<int>`, each occurrence of `T` will be replaced with `int`.

 The following code example shows how client code uses the generic `GenericList<T>` class to create a list of integers. Simply by changing the type argument, the following code could easily be modified to create lists of strings or any other custom type:

## Generics Overview  
  
- Use generic types to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance.  
  
- The most common use of generics is to create collection classes.  
  
- The .NET Framework class library contains several new generic collection classes in the <xref:System.Collections.Generic> namespace. These should be used whenever possible instead of classes such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> in the <xref:System.Collections> namespace.  
  
- You can create your own generic interfaces, classes, methods, events and delegates.  
  
- Generic classes may be constrained to enable access to methods on particular data types.  
  
- Information on the types that are used in a generic data type may be obtained at run-time by using reflection.
