# Pointer Conversions (C# Programming Guide)
The following table shows the predefined implicit pointer conversions. Implicit conversions might occur in many situations, including method invoking and assignment statements.  
  
## Implicit pointer conversions  
  
|From|To|  
|----------|--------|  
|Any pointer type|void*|  
|null|Any pointer type|  
  
 Explicit pointer conversion is used to perform conversions, for which there is no implicit conversion, by using a cast expression. The following table shows these conversions.  
  
## Explicit pointer conversions  
  
|From|To|  
|----------|--------|  
|Any pointer type|Any other pointer type|  
|sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, or ulong|Any pointer type|  
|Any pointer type|sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, or ulong|  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, a pointer to `int` is converted to a pointer to `byte`. Notice that the pointer points to the lowest addressed byte of the variable. When you successively increment the result, up to the size of `int` (4 bytes), you can display the remaining bytes of the variable.
