# XElement Class Overview (C#)
The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> class is one of the fundamental classes in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)]. It represents an XML element. You can use this class to create elements; change the content of the element; add, change, or delete child elements; add attributes to an element; or serialize the contents of an element in text form. You can also interoperate with other classes in <xref:System.Xml?displayProperty=nameWithType>, such as <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform>.  
  
This topic describes the functionality provided by the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> class.  
  
## Constructing XML Trees  
 You can construct XML trees in a variety of ways, including the following:  
  
- You can construct an XML tree in code. For more information, see [Creating XML Trees (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-overview.md).  
  
- You can parse XML from various sources, including a <xref:System.IO.TextReader>, text files, or a Web address (URL). For more information, see [Parsing XML (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-parse-a-string.md).  
  
- You can use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to populate the tree. For more information, see <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom%2A>.  
  
- If you have a module that can write content to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, you can use the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A> method to create a writer, pass the writer to the module, and then use the content that is written to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> to populate the XML tree.  
  
 However, the most common way to create an XML tree is as follows:  
  
```csharp  
XElement contacts =  
    new XElement("Contacts",  
        new XElement("Contact",  
            new XElement("Name", "Patrick Hines"),   
            new XElement("Phone", "206-555-0144"),  
            new XElement("Address",  
                new XElement("Street1", "123 Main St"),  
                new XElement("City", "Mercer Island"),  
                new XElement("State", "WA"),  
                new XElement("Postal", "68042")  
            )  
        )  
    );  
```  
  
 Another very common technique for creating an XML tree involves using the results of a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query to populate an XML tree, as shown in the following example:  
  
```csharp  
XElement srcTree = new XElement("Root",  
    new XElement("Element", 1),  
    new XElement("Element", 2),  
    new XElement("Element", 3),  
    new XElement("Element", 4),  
    new XElement("Element", 5)  
);  
XElement xmlTree = new XElement("Root",  
    new XElement("Child", 1),  
    new XElement("Child", 2),  
    from el in srcTree.Elements()  
    where (int)el > 2  
    select el  
);  
Console.WriteLine(xmlTree);  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```xml  
<Root>  
  <Child>1</Child>  
  <Child>2</Child>  
  <Element>3</Element>  
  <Element>4</Element>  
  <Element>5</Element>  
</Root>  
```  
  
## Serializing XML Trees  
 You can serialize the XML tree to a <xref:System.IO.File>, a <xref:System.IO.TextWriter>, or an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>.  
  
 For more information, see [Serializing XML Trees (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/preserving-white-space-while-serializing.md).  
  
## Retrieving XML Data via Axis Methods  
 You can use axis methods to retrieve attributes, child elements, descendant elements, and ancestor elements. [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries operate on axis methods, and provide several flexible and powerful ways to navigate through and process an XML tree.  
  
 For more information, see [LINQ to XML Axes (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-axes-overview.md).  
  
## Querying XML Trees  
 You can write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries that extract data from an XML tree.  
  
 For more information, see [Querying XML Trees (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-find-an-element-with-a-specific-attribute.md).  
  
## Modifying XML Trees  
 You can modify an element in a variety of ways, including changing its content or attributes. You can also remove an element from its parent.  
  
 For more information, see [Modifying XML Trees (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/in-memory-xml-tree-modification-vs-functional-construction-linq-to-xml.md).
