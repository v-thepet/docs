# Arrays (C# Programming Guide)

You can store multiple variables of the same type in an array data structure. You declare an array by specifying the type of its elements.  
  
 `type[] arrayName;`  
  
 The following example creates single-dimensional, multidimensional, and jagged arrays:

## Array Overview

 An array has the following properties:  
  
- An array can be [Single-Dimensional](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/single-dimensional-arrays.md), [Multidimensional](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/multidimensional-arrays.md) or [Jagged](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/jagged-arrays.md).  
  
- The number of dimensions and the length of each dimension are established when the array instance is created. These values can't be changed during the lifetime of the instance.  
  
- The default values of numeric array elements are set to zero, and reference elements are set to null.  
  
- A jagged array is an array of arrays, and therefore its elements are reference types and are initialized to `null`.  
  
- Arrays are zero indexed: an array with `n` elements is indexed from `0` to `n-1`.  
  
- Array elements can be of any type, including an array type.  
  
- Array types are [reference types](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/reference-types.md) derived from the abstract base type <xref:System.Array>. Since this type implements <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, you can use [foreach](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in.md) iteration on all arrays in C#.
