# How to: Identify a nullable type (C# Programming Guide)

The following example shows how to determine whether a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance represents a closed generic nullable type, that is, the <xref:System.Nullable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> type with a specified type parameter `T`:

[!code-csharp-interactive[whether Type is nullable](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/IdentifyNullableType.cs#1)]

As the example shows, you use the [typeof](../../language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-conversion-operators.md#typeof-operator) operator to create a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> object.  
  
If you want to determine whether an instance is of a nullable type, don't use the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to get a <xref:System.Type> instance to be tested with the preceding code. When you call the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method on an instance of a nullable type, the instance is [boxed](using-nullable-types.md#boxing-and-unboxing) to <xref:System.Object>. As boxing of a non-null instance of a nullable type is equivalent to boxing of a value of the underlying type, <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A> returns a <xref:System.Type> object that represents the underlying type of a nullable type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[GetType example](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/IdentifyNullableType.cs#2)]

Don't use the [is](../../language-reference/keywords/is.md) operator to determine whether an instance is of a nullable type. As the following example shows, you cannot distinguish types of instances of a nullable type and its underlying type with using the `is` operator:

[!code-csharp-interactive[is operator example](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/IdentifyNullableType.cs#3)]

You can use the code presented in the following example to determine whether an instance is of a nullable type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[whether an instance is of a nullable type](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/IdentifyNullableType.cs#4)]
