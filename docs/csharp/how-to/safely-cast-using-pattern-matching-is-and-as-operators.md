# How to: safely cast by using pattern matching and the is and as operators

Because objects are polymorphic, it's possible for a variable of a base class type to hold a derived [type](../programming-guide/types/index.md). To access the derived type's instance members, it's necessary to [cast](../programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions.md) the value back to the derived type. However, a cast creates the risk of throwing an <xref:System.InvalidCastException>. C# provides [pattern matching](../pattern-matching.md) statements that perform a cast conditionally only when it will succeed. C# also provides the [is](../language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-conversion-operators.md#is-operator) and [as](../language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-conversion-operators.md#as-operator) operators to test if a value is of a certain type.

The following code demonstrates the pattern matching `is` statement. It contains methods that test a method argument to determine if it is one of a possible set of derived types:

[!code-csharp[Pattern matching is statement](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/safelycast/patternmatching/Program.cs#PatternMatchingIs)]

The preceding sample demonstrates a few features of pattern matching syntax. The `if (a is Mammal m)` and `if (o is Mammal m)` statements combine the test with an initialization assignment. The assignment occurs only when the test succeeds. The variable `m` is only in scope in the embedded `if` statement where it has been assigned. You cannot access `m` later in the same method. Try it in the interactive window.

You can also use the same syntax for testing if a [nullable type](../programming-guide/nullable-types/index.md) has a value, as shown in the following sample code:

[!code-csharp[Pattern matching with nullable types](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/safelycast/nullablepatternmatching/Program.cs#PatternMatchingNullable)]

The preceding sample demonstrates other features of pattern matching to use with conversions. You can test a variable for the null pattern by checking specifically for the `null` value. When the runtime value of the variable is `null`, an `is` statement checking for a type always returns `false`. The pattern matching `is` statement doesn't allow a nullable value type, such as `int?` or `Nullable<int>`, but you can test for any other value type.

The preceding sample also shows how you use the pattern matching `is` expression in a `switch` statement where the variable may be one of many different types.

If you want to test if a variable is a given type, but not assign it to a new variable, you can use the `is` and `as` operators for reference types and nullable types. The following code shows how to use the `is` and `as` statements that were part of the C# language before pattern matching was introduced to test if a variable is of a given type:

[!code-csharp[testing variable types with the is and as statements](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/safelycast/asandis/Program.cs#IsAndAs)]

As you can see by comparing this code with the pattern matching code, the pattern matching syntax provides more robust features by combining the test and the assignment in a single statement. Use the pattern matching syntax whenever possible.

You can try these samples by looking at the code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/snippets/csharp/how-to/safelycast). Or you can download the samples [as a zip file](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/raw/master/snippets/csharp/how-to/safelycast.zip).
