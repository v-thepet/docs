# Replacing a Principal Object
Applications that provide authentication services must be able to replace the **Principal** object (<xref:System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal>) for a given thread. Furthermore, the security system must help protect the ability to replace **Principal** objects because a maliciously attached, incorrect **Principal** compromises the security of your application by claiming an untrue identity or role. Therefore, applications that require the ability to replace **Principal** objects must be granted the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission?displayProperty=nameWithType> object for principal control. (Note that this permission is not required for performing role-based security checks or for creating **Principal** objects.)  
  
 The current **Principal** object can be replaced by performing the following tasks:  
  
1. Create the replacement **Principal** object and associated **Identity** object.  
  
2. Attach the new **Principal** object to the call context.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to create a generic principal object and use it to set the principal of a thread.
