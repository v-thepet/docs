# What is .NET for Apache Spark?

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a general-purpose distributed processing engine for analytics over large data sets-typically terabytes or petabytes of data. .NET for Apache Spark makes Apache Spark accessible for developers, bringing the power of Spark to your applications with support for languages you already know.

With C# and F#, you can access:

* Dataframe and SparkSQL for working with structured data.
* Spark Structured Streaming for working with streaming data.

.NET for Apache Spark is compliant with .NET Standard, a formal specification of .NET APIs that are common across .NET implementations. This means you can use .NET for Apache Spark anywhere you write .NET code allowing you to reuse all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer.

.NET for Apache Spark runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core. It also runs on Windows using .NET Framework. You can deploy your applications to all major cloud providers including Azure HDInsight Spark, Amazon EMR Spark, Azure Databricks, and Databricks on AWS.

## .NET Foundation

The .NET for Apache Spark project is part of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/).
