# Explore custom HTTP call retries with exponential backoff

To create resilient microservices, you need to handle possible HTTP failure scenarios. One way of handling those failures, although not recommended, is to create your own implementation of retries with exponential backoff.

**Important note:** This section shows you how you could create your own custom code to implement HTTP call retries. However, it isn't recommended to do it on your own but to use more powerful and reliable while simpler to use mechanisms, such as `HttpClientFactory` with Polly, available since .NET Core 2.1. Those recommended approaches are explained in the next sections.

As an initial exploration, you could implement your own code with a utility class for exponential backoff as in [RetryWithExponentialBackoff.cs](https://gist.github.com/CESARDELATORRE/6d7f647b29e55fdc219ee1fd2babb260), plus code like the following.

```csharp
public sealed class RetryWithExponentialBackoff
{
    private readonly int maxRetries, delayMilliseconds, maxDelayMilliseconds;

    public RetryWithExponentialBackoff(int maxRetries = 50,
        int delayMilliseconds = 200,
        int maxDelayMilliseconds = 2000)
    {
        this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
        this.delayMilliseconds = delayMilliseconds;
        this.maxDelayMilliseconds = maxDelayMilliseconds;
    }

    public async Task RunAsync(Func<Task> func)
    {
        ExponentialBackoff backoff = new ExponentialBackoff(this.maxRetries,
            this.delayMilliseconds,
            this.maxDelayMilliseconds);
        retry:
        try
        {
            await func();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is TimeoutException ||
            ex is System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Exception raised is: " +
                ex.GetType().ToString() +
                " â€“Message: " + ex.Message +
                " -- Inner Message: " +
                ex.InnerException.Message);
            await backoff.Delay();
            goto retry;
        }
    }
}

public struct ExponentialBackoff
{
    private readonly int m_maxRetries, m_delayMilliseconds, m_maxDelayMilliseconds;
    private int m_retries, m_pow;

    public ExponentialBackoff(int maxRetries, int delayMilliseconds,
        int maxDelayMilliseconds)
    {
        m_maxRetries = maxRetries;
        m_delayMilliseconds = delayMilliseconds;
        m_maxDelayMilliseconds = maxDelayMilliseconds;
        m_retries = 0;
        m_pow = 1;
    }

    public Task Delay()
    {
        if (m_retries == m_maxRetries)
        {
            throw new TimeoutException("Max retry attempts exceeded.");
        }
        ++m_retries;
        if (m_retries < 31)
        {
            m_pow = m_pow << 1; // m_pow = Pow(2, m_retries - 1)
        }
        int delay = Math.Min(m_delayMilliseconds * (m_pow - 1) / 2,
            m_maxDelayMilliseconds);
        return Task.Delay(delay);
    }
}
```

Using this code in a client C\# application (another Web API client microservice, an ASP.NET MVC application, or even a C\# Xamarin application) is straightforward. The following example shows how, using the HttpClient class.

```csharp
public async Task<Catalog> GetCatalogItems(int page,int take, int? brand, int? type)
{
    _apiClient = new HttpClient();
    var itemsQs = $"items?pageIndex={page}&pageSize={take}";
    var filterQs = "";
    var catalogUrl = $"{_remoteServiceBaseUrl}items{filterQs}?pageIndex={page}&pageSize={take}";
    var dataString = "";
    //
    // Using HttpClient with Retry and Exponential Backoff
    //
    var retry = new RetryWithExponentialBackoff();
    await retry.RunAsync(async () =>
    {
        // work with HttpClient call
        dataString = await _apiClient.GetStringAsync(catalogUrl);
    });
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Catalog>(dataString);
}
```

Remember that this code is suitable only as a proof of concept. The next sections explain how to use more sophisticated approaches while simpler, by using HttpClientFactory. HttpClientFactory is available since .NET Core 2.1, with proven resiliency libraries like Polly.
