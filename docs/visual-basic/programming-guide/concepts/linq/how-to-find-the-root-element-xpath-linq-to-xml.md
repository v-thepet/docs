# How to: Find the Root Element (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
This topic shows how to get the root element with XPath and [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)].  
  
 The XPath expression is:  
  
 `/PurchaseOrders`  
  
## Example  
 This example finds the root element.  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Multiple Purchase Orders (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-multiple-purchase-orders-linq-to-xml.md).  
  
```vb  
Dim po As XDocument = XDocument.Load("PurchaseOrders.xml")  
  
' LINQ to XML query  
Dim el1 As XElement = po.Root  
  
' XPath expression  
Dim el2 As XElement = po.XPathSelectElement("/PurchaseOrders")  
  
If el1 Is el2 Then  
    Console.WriteLine("Results are identical")  
Else  
    Console.WriteLine("Results differ")  
End If  
Console.WriteLine(el1.Name)  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```  
Results are identical  
PurchaseOrders  
```
