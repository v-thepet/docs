# Serializing XML Trees (Visual Basic)
Serializing an XML tree means generating XML from the XML tree. You can serialize to a file, to a concrete implementation of the <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> class, or to a concrete implementation of an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>.  
  
 You can control various aspects of serialization. For example, you can control whether to indent the serialized XML, and whether to write an XML declaration.
