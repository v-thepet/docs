# How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)
This topic shows how to create an XML tree in C#.  
  
## Example  
 You can parse a string in Visual Basic by using the `XElement.Parse` method. However, it is more efficient to use XML literals, as shown in following code, because XML literals do not suffer from the same performance penalties as parsing XML from a string.  
  
 By using XML literals, you can just copy and paste your XML into your Visual Basic program.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Parsing text or loading an XML document from a text file is less efficient than functional construction. If you are initializing an XML tree from code, it takes less processor time to use functional construction than to parse text.  
  
```vb  
Dim contacts as XElement = _  
    <Contacts>  
        <Contact>  
            <Name>Patrick Hines</Name>  
            <Phone Type="home">206-555-0144</Phone>  
            <Phone Type="work">425-555-0145</Phone>  
            <Address>  
            <Street1>123 Main St</Street1>  
            <City>Mercer Island</City>  
            <State>WA</State>  
            <Postal>68042</Postal>  
            </Address>

        </Contact>
