# Parsing XML (Visual Basic)
The topics in this section describe how to parse XML documents.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-parse-a-string.md)|Shows how to parse a string to create an XML tree.|  
|[How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-load-xml-from-a-file.md)|Shows how to load XML from a URI using the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Load%2A> method.|  
|[Preserving White Space while Loading or Parsing XML](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/preserving-white-space-while-loading-or-parsing-xml.md)|Describes how to control the white space behavior of [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] while loading XML trees.|  
|[How to: Catch Parsing Errors (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-catch-parsing-errors.md)|Shows how to detect badly formed or invalid XML.|  
|[How to: Create a Tree from an XmlReader (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-create-a-tree-from-an-xmlreader.md)|Shows how to create an XML tree directly from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.|  
|[How to: Stream XML Fragments from an XmlReader (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-from-an-xmlreader.md)|Shows how to stream XML fragments by using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.<br /><br /> When you have to process arbitrarily large XML files, it might not be feasible to load the whole XML tree into memory. Instead, you can stream XML fragments.|
