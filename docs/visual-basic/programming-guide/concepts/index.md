# Programming Concepts (Visual Basic)

This section explains programming concepts in the Visual Basic language.

## In this section

|Title|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|[Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md)|Describes how to write asynchronous solutions by using [Async](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md) keywords. Includes a walkthrough.|
|[Attributes overview (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index.md)|Discusses how to provide additional information about programming elements such as types, fields, methods, and properties by using attributes.|
|[Caller Information (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/caller-information.md)|Describes how to obtain information about the caller of a method. This information includes the file path and the line number of the source code and the member name of the caller.|
|[Collections (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/collections.md)|Describes some of the types of collections provided by the .NET Framework. Demonstrates how to use simple collections and collections of key/value pairs.|
|[Covariance and Contravariance (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/index.md)|Shows how to enable implicit conversion of generic type parameters in interfaces and delegates.|
|[Expression Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)|Explains how you can use expression trees to enable dynamic modification of executable code.|
|[Iterators (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/iterators.md)|Describes iterators, which are used to step through collections and return elements one at a time.|
|[Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)|Discusses the powerful query capabilities in the language syntax of Visual Basic, and the model for querying relational databases, XML documents, datasets, and in-memory collections.|
|[Object-Oriented Programming (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming.md)|Describes common object-oriented concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.|
|[Reflection (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/reflection.md)|Explains how to use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.|
|[Serialization (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)|Describes key concepts in binary, XML, and SOAP serialization.|
