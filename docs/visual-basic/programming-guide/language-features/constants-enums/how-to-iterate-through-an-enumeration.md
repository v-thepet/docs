# How to: Iterate Through An Enumeration in Visual Basic
Enumerations provide a convenient way to work with sets of related constants, and to associate constant values with names. To iterate through an enumeration, you can move it into an array using the <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method. You could also iterate through an enumeration using a `For...Each` statement, using the <xref:System.Enum.GetNames%2A> or <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method to extract the string or numeric value.  
  
### To iterate through an enumeration  
  
- Declare an array and convert the enumeration to it with the <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method before passing the array as you would any other variable. The following example displays each member of the enumeration <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FirstDayOfWeek> as it iterates through the enumeration.
