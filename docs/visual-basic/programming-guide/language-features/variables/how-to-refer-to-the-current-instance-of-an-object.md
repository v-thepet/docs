# How to: Refer to the Current Instance of an Object (Visual Basic)
The *current instance* of an object is the instance in which the code is currently executing.  
  
 You use the `Me` keyword to refer to the current instance.  
  
### To refer to the current instance  
  
- Use the `Me` keyword where you would normally use the name of an object variable.  
  
    ```  
    Me.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Crimson  
    Me.Close()  
    ```  
  
     Although `Me` behaves like an object variable, you cannot declare it or assign anything to it. `Me` always refers to the current instance.
