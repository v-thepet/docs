# IsNot Operator (Visual Basic)
Compares two object reference variables.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
result = object1 IsNot object2  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `result`  
 Required. A `Boolean` value.  
  
 `object1`  
 Required. Any `Object` variable or expression.  
  
 `object2`  
 Required. Any `Object` variable or expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `IsNot` operator determines if two object references refer to different objects. However, it does not perform value comparisons. If `object1` and `object2` both refer to the exact same object instance, `result` is `False`; if they do not, `result` is `True`.  
  
 `IsNot` is the opposite of the `Is` operator. The advantage of `IsNot` is that you can avoid awkward syntax with `Not` and `Is`, which can be difficult to read.  
  
 You can use the `Is` and `IsNot` operators to test both early-bound and late-bound objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `IsNot` operator cannot be used to compare expressions returned from the `TypeOf` operator. Instead, you must use the `Not` and `Is` operators.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example uses both the `Is` operator and the `IsNot` operator to accomplish the same comparison.
