# = Operator (Visual Basic)
Assigns a value to a variable or property.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
variableorproperty = value  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `variableorproperty`  
 Any writable variable or any property.  
  
 `value`  
 Any literal, constant, or expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The element on the left side of the equal sign (`=`) can be a simple scalar variable, a property, or an element of an array. The variable or property cannot be [ReadOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md). The `=` operator assigns the value on its right to the variable or property on its left.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `=` operator is also used as a comparison operator. For details, see [Comparison Operators](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/comparison-operators.md).  
  
## Overloading  
 The `=` operator can be overloaded only as a relational comparison operator, not as an assignment operator. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates the assignment operator. The value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left.
