# Is Operator (Visual Basic)
Compares two object reference variables.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
result = object1 Is object2  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `result`  
 Required. Any `Boolean` value.  
  
 `object1`  
 Required. Any `Object` name.  
  
 `object2`  
 Required. Any `Object` name.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Is` operator determines if two object references refer to the same object. However, it does not perform value comparisons. If `object1` and `object2` both refer to the exact same object instance, `result` is `True`; if they do not, `result` is `False`.  
  
 `Is` can also be used with the `TypeOf` keyword to make a `TypeOf`...`Is` expression, which tests whether an object variable is compatible with a data type.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `Is` keyword is also used in the [Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `Is` operator to compare pairs of object references. The results are assigned to a `Boolean` value representing whether the two objects are identical.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#27](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOperators/VB/Class1.vb#27)]  
  
 As the preceding example demonstrates, you can use the `Is` operator to test both early bound and late bound objects.
