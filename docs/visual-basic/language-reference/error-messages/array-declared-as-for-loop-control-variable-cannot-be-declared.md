# Array declared as for loop control variable cannot be declared with an initial size
A `For Each` loop uses an array as its *element* iteration variable but initializes that array.  
  
 The following statements show how this error can be generated.  
  
```  
Dim arrayList As New List(Of Integer())  
For Each listElement() As Integer In arrayList  
For Each listElement(1) As Integer In arrayList  
```  
  
 The first `For Each` statement is the correct way to access elements of `arrayList`. The second `For Each` statement generates this error.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32039  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the initialization from the declaration of the *element* iteration variable.
