# Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate
There is an incompatibility between the signatures of the method and the delegate you are trying to use. The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure that has matching parameters of compatible types and return types can be used to create an instance of this delegate type.  
  
 **Error ID**: BC36563
