# Take While Clause (Visual Basic)
Includes elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is `true` and bypasses the remaining elements.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Take While expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|---|---|  
|`expression`|Required. An expression that represents a condition to test elements for. The expression must return a `Boolean` value or a functional equivalent, such as an `Integer` to be evaluated as a `Boolean`.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Take While` clause includes elements from the start of a query result until the supplied `expression` returns `false`. After the `expression` returns `false`, the query will bypass all remaining elements. The `expression` is ignored for the remaining results.  
  
 The `Take While` clause differs from the `Where` clause in that the `Where` clause can be used to include all elements from a query that meet a particular condition. The `Take While` clause includes elements only until the first time that the condition is not satisfied. The `Take While` clause is most useful when you are working with an ordered query result.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example uses the `Take While` clause to retrieve results until the first customer without any orders is found.
