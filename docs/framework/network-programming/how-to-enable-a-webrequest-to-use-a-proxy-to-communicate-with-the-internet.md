# How to: Enable a WebRequest to Use a Proxy to Communicate With the Internet
This example creates a global proxy instance that will enable any <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> to use a proxy to communicate with the Internet. The example assumes that the proxy server is named `webproxy` and that it communicates on port 80, the standard HTTP port.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
WebProxy proxyObject = new WebProxy("http://webproxy:80/");  
GlobalProxySelection.Select = proxyObject;  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim proxyObject As WebProxy = New WebProxy("http://webproxy:80/")  
GlobalProxySelection.Select = proxyObject  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
- A [`using` directive](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive.md) for the **System.Net** namespace.
