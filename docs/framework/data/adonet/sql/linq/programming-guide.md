# Programming Guide
This section contains information about how to create and use your [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model. If you are using Visual Studio, you can also use the Object Relational Designer to perform many of these same tasks.  
  
 You can also search Microsoft Docs for specific issues, and you can participate in the [LINQ Forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76488), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts. Finally, the [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93205) white paper details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with Visual Basic and C# code examples.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Creating the Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/creating-the-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to generate an object model.  
  
 [Communicating with the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/communicating-with-the-database.md)  
 Describes how to use a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object as a conduit to the database.  
  
 [Querying the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/querying-the-database.md)  
 Describes how to execute queries in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], and provides many examples.  
  
 [Making and Submitting Data Changes](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/making-and-submitting-data-changes.md)  
 Describes how change data in the database.  
  
 [Debugging Support](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/debugging-support.md)

 [Background Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)  
 Includes additional items, such as concurrency conflict resolution, creating new databases, and more, for more advanced users.
