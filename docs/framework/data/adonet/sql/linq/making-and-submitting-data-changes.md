# Making and Submitting Data Changes
The topics in this section describe how to make and transmit changes to the database and how to handle optimistic concurrency conflicts.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations. For more information, see [Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/customizing-insert-update-and-delete-operations.md).  
>   
>  Developers using Visual Studio can use the Object Relational Designer to develop stored procedures for the same purpose.
