# Querying DataSets (LINQ to DataSet)
After a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object has been populated with data, you can begin querying it. Formulating queries with LINQ to DataSet is similar to using [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] against other [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)]-enabled data sources. Remember, however, that when you use [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries over a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object you are querying an enumeration of <xref:System.Data.DataRow> objects, instead of an enumeration of a custom type. This means that you can use any of the members of the <xref:System.Data.DataRow> class in your [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries. This lets you to create rich, complex queries.  
  
 As with other implementations of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)], you can create LINQ to DataSet queries in two different forms: query expression syntax and method-based query syntax. You can use query expression syntax or method-based query syntax to perform queries against single tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, against multiple tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, or against tables in a typed <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.
