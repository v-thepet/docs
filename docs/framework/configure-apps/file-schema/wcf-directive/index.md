# WCF Directive Syntax
Specifies settings used by the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) directives in the .svc files to direct the compilers. Each directive can contain one or more attributes (paired with values) that are specific to that directive. WCF has only the [\@ServiceHost](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf-directive/servicehost.md) directive.  
  
## In This Section  
 [@ServiceHost](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf-directive/servicehost.md)  
 Defines page-specific attributes used by the .svc compiler. Can be included only in .svc files.
