# Windows Workflow (WF) Samples

You can [download Windows Workflow samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) that provide instruction on various aspects of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF).

The articles in this section describe some of the samples in the download package. For a complete documentation set that covers all of the samples, check the [.NET Framework 4 WF samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd483375(v%3dvs.100)) section.

> [!NOTE]
> The downloadable samples were created with Visual Studio 2010 and [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)], but are compatible with later versions of Visual Studio and the .NET Framework. Additional samples for Windows Workflow Foundation in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] can be found on [MSDN code samples](https://aka.ms/WF45Samples).
