# ETW Events in the .NET Framework
Event tracing for Windows (ETW) is a high-performance, low-overhead, scalable tracing system provided by Windows operating systems. It supplements the profiling and debugging support provided by the .NET Framework and can be used to troubleshoot a variety of scenarios.  
  
 In the .NET Framework, ETW event tracing is available for the common language runtime (CLR), the [Task Parallel Library](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl.md), and [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [ETW Events in Task Parallel Library and PLINQ](../../../docs/framework/performance/etw-events-in-task-parallel-library-and-plinq.md)  
 Describes how to profile parallel application code.  
  
 [ETW Events in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/performance/etw-events-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)  
 Describes how CLR ETW events supplement the profiling and debugging support provided by the common language runtime.
