# How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly
The <xref:System.Reflection> namespace contains many methods for obtaining information from an assembly. This section demonstrates one of these methods. For additional information, see [Reflection Overview](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md).  
  
 The following example obtains type and member information from an assembly.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/cpp/source6.cpp#8)]
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/cs/source6.cs#8)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/vb/source6.vb#8)]
