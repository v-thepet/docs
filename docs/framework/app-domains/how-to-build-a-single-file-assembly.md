# How to: Build a Single-File Assembly

A single-file assembly, which is the simplest type of assembly, contains type information and implementation, as well as the [assembly manifest](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-manifest.md). You can use command-line compilers or Visual Studio to create a single-file assembly. By default, the compiler creates an assembly file with an .exe extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio for C# and Visual Basic can be used only to create single-file assemblies. If you want to create multifile assemblies, you must use command-line compilers or Visual C++.

The following procedures show how to create single-file assemblies using command-line compilers.

## To create an assembly with an .exe extension

1. At the command prompt, type the following command:

     \<*compiler command*> \<*module name*>

     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.

 The following example creates an assembly named `myCode.exe` from a code module called `myCode`.

```console
csc myCode.cs
```

```console
vbc myCode.vb
```

### To create an assembly with an .exe extension and specify the output file name

1. At the command prompt, type the following command:

     \<*compiler command*> **/out:**\<*file name*> \<*module name*>

     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, *file name* is the output file name, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.

 The following example creates an assembly named `myAssembly.exe` from a code module called `myCode`.

```console
csc -out:myAssembly.exe myCode.cs
```

```console
vbc -out:myAssembly.exe myCode.vb
```

## Creating Library Assemblies
 A library assembly is similar to a class library. It contains types that will be referenced by other assemblies, but it has no entry point to begin execution.

### To create a library assembly

1. At the command prompt, type the following command:

     \<*compiler command*> **-t:library** \<*module name*>

     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly. You can also use other compiler options, such as the **-out:** option.

 The following example creates a library assembly named `myCodeAssembly.dll` from a code module called `myCode`.

```console
csc -out:myCodeLibrary.dll -t:library myCode.cs
```

```console
vbc -out:myCodeLibrary.dll -t:library myCode.vb
```
