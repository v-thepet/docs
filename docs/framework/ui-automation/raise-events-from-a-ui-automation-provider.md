# Raise Events from a UI Automation Provider
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 This topic contains example code that shows how to raise an event from a UI Automation provider.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] event is raised in the implementation of a custom button control. The implementation enables a UI Automation client application to simulate a button click.  
  
 To avoid unnecessary processing, the example checks <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.AutomationInteropProvider.ClientsAreListening%2A> to see whether events should be raised.
