# WCF System Requirements
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a communication infrastructure that is used to create distributed applications. The following lists the requirements that enable WCF to run.  
  
## System Requirements  
 WCF is installed by default on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../includes/wv-md.md)].  
  
 WCF can also be installed on [!INCLUDE[wxpsp2](../../../includes/wxpsp2-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ws2003r2](../../../includes/ws2003r2-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ws2003sp1](../../../includes/ws2003sp1-md.md)].  
  
 **Note** The Message Queuing (MSMQ) functionality of WCF is supported only on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../includes/wv-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ws2003r2](../../../includes/ws2003r2-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ws2003sp1](../../../includes/ws2003sp1-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[wxppro](../../../includes/wxppro-md.md)].
