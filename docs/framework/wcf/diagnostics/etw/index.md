# Analytic Tracing with ETW
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) analytic tracing offers a way to capture diagnostic information during the execution of a WCF service. WCF analytic tracing events are emitted at key points in the WCF stack to allow troubleshooting of WCF services in a production environment. Analytic tracing for WCF services has minimal impact on the performance of a product server that hosts [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] WCF services as these events are very efficiently emitted to an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Analytic Tracing Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-tracing-overview.md)  
 Discusses how WCF analytic tracing works in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Dynamically Enabling Analytic Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/dynamically-enabling-analytic-tracing.md)  
 Discusses how to enable or disable tracing dynamically using ETW.  
  
 [Configuring Message Flow Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/configuring-message-flow-tracing.md)  
 Describes how to configure message flow tracing.  
  
 [Analytic Trace Event Reference](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-trace-event-reference.md)  
 Shows a table of event IDs with their event levels, event messages and keywords.
