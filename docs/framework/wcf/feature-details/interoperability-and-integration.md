# Interoperability and Integration
This section covers interoperability and integration with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Web Services Protocols Interoperability Guide](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/web-services-protocols-interoperability-guide.md)  
 WCF is built to interoperate with Web services that support a set of specifications known as the Web services specifications. This topic lists specifications that are supported and the bindings that support them.  
  
 [Integrating with COM+ Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications.md)  
 Discusses how COM+ applications can be exposed as WCF services.  
  
 [Integrating with COM Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-applications.md)  
 Discusses the various methods for COM applications to call WCF services.  
  
 [Migrating .NET Remoting Applications to WCF](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/migrating-net-remoting-applications-to-wcf.md)  
 Describes how WCF can be used with .NET Framework remoting.  
  
 [Interoperability with Web Services Enhancements 3.0](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/interoperability-with-web-services-enhancements-3-0.md)  
 Describes how WCF can be used with Web services implemented with Web Services Enhancements (WSE) 3.0.  
  
 [Migrating WSE 3.0 Web Services to WCF](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/migrating-wse-3-0-web-services-to-wcf.md)
