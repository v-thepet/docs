# Feedback and Community
We appreciate your comments and concerns about the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) or CardSpace documentation.

 If you are looking for more information, or want to share techniques with others who are interested in WCF, try the [MSDN Windows Communication Foundation forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186463).
