# Assertions

The `assert` expression is a debugging feature that you can use to test an expression. Upon failure in Debug mode, an assertion generates a system error dialog box.

## Syntax

```fsharp
assert condition
```

## Remarks

The `assert` expression has type `bool -> unit`.

In the previous syntax, *condition* represents a Boolean expression that is to be tested. If the expression evaluates to `true`, execution continues unaffected. If it evaluates to `false`, a system error dialog box is generated. The error dialog box has a caption that contains the string **Assertion Failed**. The dialog box contains a stack trace that indicates where the assertion failure occurred.

Assertion checking is enabled only when you compile in Debug mode; that is, if the constant `DEBUG` is defined. In the project system, by default, the `DEBUG` constant is defined in the Debug configuration but not in the Release configuration.

The assertion failure error cannot be caught by using F# exception handling.

> [!NOTE]
> The `assert` function resolves to <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert*?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Example

The following code example illustrates the use of the `assert` expression.
