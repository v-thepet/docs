# Recursive Functions: The rec Keyword

The `rec` keyword is used together with the `let` keyword to define a recursive function.

## Syntax

```fsharp
// Recursive function:
let rec function-nameparameter-list =
function-body

// Mutually recursive functions:
let rec function1-nameparameter-list =
function1-body
and function2-nameparameter-list =
function2-body
...
```

## Remarks

Recursive functions, functions that call themselves, are identified explicitly in the F# language. This makes the identifer that is being defined available in the scope of the function.

The following code illustrates a recursive function that computes the *n*<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, code like that above is wasteful of memory and processor time because it involves the recomputation of previously computed values.

Methods are implicitly recursive within the type; there is no need to add the `rec` keyword. Let bindings within classes are not implicitly recursive.

## Mutually Recursive Functions

Sometimes functions are *mutually recursive*, meaning that calls form a circle, where one function calls another which in turn calls the first, with any number of calls in between. You must define such functions together in the one `let` binding, using the `and` keyword to link them together.

The following example shows two mutually recursive functions.
