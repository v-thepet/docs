### DeflateStream uses native APIs for decompression

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.2, the implementation of decompression in the <code>T:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream</code> class has changed to use native Windows APIs by default. Typically, this results in a substantial performance improvement. All .NET applications targeting the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 or higher use the native implementation.This change might result in some differences in behavior, which include:<ul><li>Exception messages may be different. However, the type of exception thrown remains the same.</li><li>Some special situations, such as not having enough memory to complete an operation, may be handled differently.</li><li>There are known differences for parsing gzip header (note: only <code>GZipStream</code> set for decompression is affected):</li><li>Exceptions when parsing invalid headers may be thrown at different times.</li><li>The native implementation enforces that values for some reserved flags inside the gzip header (i.e. [FLG](http://www.zlib.org/rfc-gzip.html#header-trailer)) are set according to the specification, which may cause it to throw an exception where previously invalid values were ignored.</li></ul>|
|Suggestion|If decompression with native APIs has adversely affected the behavior of your app, you can opt out of this feature by adding the <code>Switch.System.IO.Compression.DoNotUseNativeZipLibraryForDecompression</code> switch to the <code>runtime</code> section of your app.config file and setting it to <code>true</code>:<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;configuration&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;runtime&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;AppContextSwitchOverrides&#13;&#10;value=&quot;Switch.System.IO.Compression.DoNotUseNativeZipLibraryForDecompression=true&quot; /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/runtime&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/configuration&gt;&#13;&#10;</code></pre>|
