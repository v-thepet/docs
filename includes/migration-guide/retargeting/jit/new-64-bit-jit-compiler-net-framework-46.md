### New 64-bit JIT compiler in the .NET Framework 4.6

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|Starting with the .NET Framework 4.6, a new 64-bit JIT compiler is used for just-in-time compilation. In some cases, an unexpected exception is thrown or a different behavior is observed than if an app is run using the 32-bit compiler or the older 64-bit JIT compiler. This change does not affect the 32-bit JIT compiler.The known differences include the following:<ul><li>Under certain conditions, an unboxing operation may throw a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in Release builds with optimization turned on.</li><li>In some cases, execution of production code in a large method body may throw a <xref:System.StackOverflowException>.</li><li>Under certain conditions, structures passed to a method are treated as reference types rather than as value types in Release builds. One of the manifestations of this issue is that the individual items in a collection appear in an unexpected order.</li><li>Under certain conditions, the comparison of <xref:System.UInt16> values with their high bit set is incorrect if optimization is enabled.</li><li>Under certain conditions, particularly when initializing array values, memory initialization by the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.OpCodes.Initblk?displayProperty=nameWithType> IL instruction may initialize memory with an incorrect value. This can result either in an unhandled exception or incorrect output.</li><li>Under certain rare conditions, a conditional bit test can return the incorrect <xref:System.Boolean> value or throw an exception if compiler optimizations are enabled.</li><li>Under certain conditions, if an <code>if</code> statement is used to test for a condition before entering  a <code>try</code> block and in the exit from the <code>try</code> block, and the same condition is evaluated in the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> block, the new 64-bit JIT compiler removes the <code>if</code> condition from the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> block when it optimizes code. As a result, code inside the <code>if</code> statement in the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> block is executed unconditionally.</li></ul>|
|Suggestion|<strong>Mitigation of known issues</strong> <br/> If you encounter the issues listed above, you can address them by doing any of the following:<ul><li>Upgrade to the .NET Framework 4.6.2. The new 64-bit compiler included with the .NET Framework 4.6.2 addresses each of these known issues.</li><li>Ensure that your version of Windows is up to date by running Windows Update. Service updates to the .NET Framework 4.6 and 4.6.1 address each of these issues except the <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in an unboxing operation.</li><li>Compile with the older 64-bit JIT compiler. See the <strong>Mitigation of other issues</strong> section for more information on how to do this.</li></ul><strong>Mitigation of other issues</strong> <br/> If you encounter any other difference in behavior between code compiled with the older 64-bit compiler and the new 64-bit JIT compiler, or between the debug and release versions of your app that are both compiled with the new 64-bit JIT compiler, you can do the following to compile your app with the older 64-bit JIT compiler:<ul><li>On a per-application basis, you can add the [<](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/uselegacyjit-element.md) element to your application's configuration file. The following disables compilation with the new 64-bit JIT compiler and instead uses the legacy 64-bit JIT compiler.</li></ul><pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;?xml version =&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;configuration&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;runtime&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;useLegacyJit enabled=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/runtime&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/configuration&gt;&#13;&#10;</code></pre><ul><li>On a per-user basis, you can add a <code>REG_DWORD</code> value named <code>useLegacyJit</code> to the <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework</code> key of the registry. A value of 1 enables the legacy 64-bit JIT compiler; a value of 0 disables it and enables the new 64-bit JIT compiler.</li><li>On a per-machine basis, you can add a <code>REG_DWORD</code> value named <code>useLegacyJit</code> to the <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework</code> key of the registry. A value of <code>1</code> enables the legacy 64-bit JIT compiler; a value of <code>0</code> disables it and enables the new 64-bit JIT compiler.</li></ul>You can also let us know about the problem by reporting a bug on [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio).|
