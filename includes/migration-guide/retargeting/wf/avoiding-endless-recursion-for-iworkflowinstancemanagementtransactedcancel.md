### Avoiding endless recursion for IWorkflowInstanceManagement.TransactedCancel and IWorkflowInstanceManagement.TransactedTerminate

|Details|Under some circumstances when using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.IWorkflowInstanceManagement.TransactedCancel%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.IWorkflowInstanceManagement.TransactedTerminate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> APIs to cancel or terminate a worklow service instance, the workflow instance may encounter a stack overflow due to endless recursion when the <code>Workflow</code> runtime attempts to persist the service instance as part of processing the request. The problem occurs if the workflow instance is in a state where it is waiting for some other outstanding WCF request to another service to complete.The <code>TransactedCancel</code> and <code>TransactedTerminate</code> operations create work items that are queued for the workflow service instance. These work items are not executed as part of the processing of the <code>TransactedCancel/TransactedTerminate</code> request. Because the workflow service instance is busy waiting for the other outstanding WCF request to complete, the work item created remains queued. The <code>TransactedCancel/TransactedTerminate</code> operation completes and control is returned back to the client. When the transaction associated with the <code>TransactedCancel/TransactedTerminate</code> operation attempts to commit, it needs to persist the workflow serivce instance state. But because there is an outstanding <code>WCF</code> request for the instance, the Workflow runtime cannot persist the workflow service instance, and an endless recursion loop leads to the stack overflow.Because <code>TransactedCancel</code> and <code>TransactedTerminate</code> only create a work item in memory, the fact that a transaction exists doesn't have any effect. A rollback of the transaction does not discard the work item.To address this issue, starting in .NET Framework 4.7.2, we have introduced an <code>AppSetting</code> that can be added to the <code>web.config/app.config</code> of the workflow service that tells it to ignore transactions for <code>TransactedCancel</code> and <code>TransactedTerminate</code>. This allows the transaction to commit without waiting for the workflow instance to persist.The AppSetting for this feature is named <code>microsoft:WorkflowServices:IgnoreTransactionsForTransactedCancelAndTransactedTerminate</code>. A value of <code>true</code> indicates that the transaction should be ignored, thus avoiding the stack overflow. The default value of this AppSetting is <code>false</code>, so existing workflow service instances are not affected.|
|Suggestion|If you are using AppFabric or another <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.IWorkflowInstanceManagement> client and are encountering a stack overflow in the workflow serivce instance when trying to cancel or terminate a workflow instance, you can add the following to the <code>&lt;appSettings&gt;</code> section of the web.config/app.config file for the workflow service:<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;add key=&quot;microsoft:WorkflowServices:IgnoreTransactionsForTransactedCancelAndTransactedTerminate&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&#13;&#10;</code></pre>If you are not encountering the problem, you do not need to do this.|
