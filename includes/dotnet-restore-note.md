> [!NOTE]
> Starting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK, you don't have to run [`dotnet restore`](~/docs/core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) because it's run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as `dotnet new`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`.
> It's still a valid command in certain scenarios where doing an explicit restore makes sense, such as [continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/build-release/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-core) or in build systems that need to explicitly control the time at which the restore occurs.
